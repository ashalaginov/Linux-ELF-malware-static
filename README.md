# Linux-ELF-malware-static-analysis
A collection of scripts to simple Linux ELF (x86/x64) only malware analsysis, including VirusShare collection processing, static analysis and automated features extraction for subsequent Data Analytics applications.


## Description
Through the history of desktop and server-oriented malware, Microsoft Windows was notoriously known as one of the heavily attacked Operating Systems (OS). Several factors caused this, including unobstructed installation of 3rd party software. Unix-like OS is considerably less susceptible to malware infections. However, there are still a few examples of successful malicious software. The challenge is that there are not that many software tools available to analyze Linux malware and do automated processing. This is a set of scripts aimed at static features extraction in addition to labelling Linux malware into families and type based on the input from VirusTotal.


## Data flow phases
We focus specifically on Linux PC malware (Intel 3086 and x86-64) and not on ARM / MIPS platforms, while having many more samples for our experimentation. It was developed the following methodology using static analysis based on the characteristics from Linux native tools and threat intelligence from VirusTotal platform.

- Phase 0: Acquiring samples from VirusShare - the most comprehensive and known in information security community ELF Linux malware samples that are also publicly available. 

- Phase 1: Filtering all files that are not completed for ELF architecture, Performing extraction of raw information for every malware binary file such as `md5`, JSON `peframe` report, `readelf`, `file`, `strings`, file size and entropy. All information is being stored in MySQL database for easier subsequent access.

- Phase 2: Filtering ELF Linux malware samples that have been compiled for either Intel 3086 or Intel x64-86 platform based on extracted metadata. We specifically exclude any other binaries such as ARM / MIPS to facilitate a better "ground truth" in experiments and unbiased results. Then, it was performed an extraction of the reports using VirusTotal Private API.

- Phase 3: Feature extraction is being performed on all types of raw data extracted at the previous phase. As a basis, the following categories of metadata and characteristics were used: `virustotal_file_report`, `peframe`, `readelf`,  `strings`, `file_size` and `file_entropy`. 



## Dataset
As input it was used:
-VirusShare_ELF_20140617.zip - 2,778 files
-VirusShare_ELF_20190212.zip - 10,426files 
-VirusShare_ELF_20200405.zip - 43,553files 
-VirusShare_Linux_20160715.zip - 9,469

The output resulted in 10,574 MySQL entries corresponding to labelled malware files into families and types. In overall, 30 extracted features were extracted.

FEATURES:

`vt_times_submitted` - Times the binary was submitted 
`vt_exif` - Number of entries in `exiftool` 
-`vt_embedded_ips` - Number of embedded IPs in the binary 
-`vt_contacted_ips` - Number of IPs the binary contacted 
-`vt_exports` - Number of export functions 
-`vt_imports`  -  Number of import functions
-`vt_shared_libraries` - Number of shared libraries included
-`vt_segments` - Number of segments
-`vt_sections` - Number of sections
-`vt_packers` - Number of packers 
-`vt_tags` - Number of tags 
-`vt_positives` - Number of AV identified as malicious  hline
-`peframe_ip` -  Number of identified IP addresses 
-`peframe_url` -  Number of identified URLs  hline
-`readelf_entry_address` -  Entry point address 
-`readelf_start_prog_headers` -  Start of program headers 
-`readelf_start_sec_headers` -  Start of section headers 
-`readelf_number_flags` -  Number of flags 
-`readelf_header_size` -  Size of this header 
-`readelf_size_prog_headers` -  Size of program headers 
-`readelf_number_prog_headers`  -  Number of program headers 
-`readelf_size_sec_headers` -  Size of section headers 
-`readelf_number_section_headers` -  Number of section headers 
-`readelf_sec_header_string_table_index` -  Section header string table index  hline
-`strings_number` - Number of distinct strings 
-`strings_size` -  Size of all strings extracted from teh file 
-`strings_avg` - Average size of each string 
-`file_size` - Size of the file 
-`file_entropy` -  Entropy of the whole file content 

LABELS:
-`type`
-`family`

This can be used as an input to any Machine Leanring methods.
