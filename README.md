# Linux-ELF-malware-static-analysis
A collection of scripts to simple Linux ELF malware analsysis, including VirusShare collection processing, static analysis and automated features extraction for subsequent Data Analytics applications.


## Description
Through the history of desktop and server-oriented malware, Microsoft Windows was notoriously known as one of the heavily attacked Operating Systems (OS). Several factors caused this, including unobstructed installation of 3rd party software. Unix-like OS is considerably less susceptible to malware infections. However, there are still a few examples of successful malicious software. The challenge is that there are not that many software tools available to analyze Linux malware, including well-known automated intelligent Machine Learning-aided classification. Our contribution in this paper is two-folded. First, we look at the most popular approaches to analyze Linux malware into families and types.


## Data flow phases
We focus specifically on Linux PC malware (Intel 3086 and x86-64) and not on ARM / MIPS platforms, while having many more samples for our experimentation. So, to yield the best possible results, we developed the following methodology using static analysis based on the characteristics from Linux native tools and threat intelligence from VirusTotal platform.

Phase 0: Acquiring samples from VirusShare - the most comprehensive and known in information security community ELF Linux malware samples that are also publicly available. 

Phase 1: Filtering all files that are not completed for ELF architecture, Performing extraction of raw information for every malware binary file such as `md5`, JSON `peframe` report, `readelf`, `file`, `strings`, file size and entropy. All information is being stored in MySQL database for easier subsequent access.

Phase 2: Filtering ELF Linux malware samples that have been compiled for either Intel 3086 or Intel x64-86 platform based on extracted metadata. We specifically exclude any other binaries such as ARM / MIPS to facilitate a better "ground truth" in experiments and unbiased results. Then, it was performed an extraction of the reports using VirusTotal Private API.

Phase 3: Feature extraction is being performed on all types of raw data extracted at the previous phase. As a basis, the following categories of metadata and characteristics were used: `virustotal_file_report`, `peframe`, `readelf`,  `strings`, `file\_size` and `file_entropy`. The description of 30 extracted features is shown in the Table.
